[EXAMPLE 2]
Question: "What is the time complexity of a bubble sort algorithm?"
Correct Answer: "O(n^2)"
Explanation:
Let's break this down. The correct answer is **O(nÂ²)**. This is because, in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm needs to compare and potentially swap every element with every other element in the list, resulting in a quadratic time complexity.
